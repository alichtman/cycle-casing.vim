# cycle-casing.vim

This plugin exposes a function to cycle between `UPPER CASE`, `lowercase` and `Title Case`.

It maps `<C-u>` to cycle the casing of the visual selection. You can disable the remap by setting

```vim
let g:cycle_casing_mapping_enabled = 0
```

The code is originally from: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Switching_case_of_characters

## Installation

```toml
Plug 'alichtman/cycle-casing.vim'
```
